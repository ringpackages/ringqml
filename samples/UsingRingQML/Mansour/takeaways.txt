KEY TAKEAWAYS:
==============

1. QML-FIRST THINKING
   - Start with QML's declarative structure
   - Design the UI visually and expressively
   - Let QML handle layout, binding, and reactivity

2. RING FOR ORCHESTRATION
   - Use Ring for business logic and data management
   - Ring.callFunc() connects QML events to Ring functions
   - Ring.getVar() and Ring.setVar() bridge data

3. SEPARATION OF CONCERNS
   - Keep QML in dedicated strings or .qml files
   - Keep Ring logic separate
   - Clear boundaries = maintainable code

4. MODERN UI PRINCIPLES
   - Use animations for polish
   - Provide immediate feedback
   - Think mobile-first, scale to desktop
   - Leverage binding for reactivity

5. ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS
   - Component-based design
   - Data-driven UIs with models
   - State management for complex UIs
   - Clean API between Ring and QML

NEXT STEPS:
===========

1. Experiment with these samples
2. Combine patterns to build your own applications
3. Move QML to .qml files for larger projects
4. Explore Qt documentation for more QML features
5. Share your RingQML creations with the community!
